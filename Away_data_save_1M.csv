The dominant performance was the third multi-goal game of the season for Reinhart, while he has recorded multiple points in nine of 14 games to begin the new campaign.

It's been reported it might take a day or two to determine the severity of the issue, and Hughes should be regarded as highly questionable for Sunday's tilt against Chicago.
